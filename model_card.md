# Model Card

## Model Details
Mohammad Rosidi created this model. It is a random forest classifier using the hyperparameters with `scikit-learn 0.24.2`: 

- `n_estimators`: 100
- `max_depth`: 7
- `criterion`: entropy
- `max_features`: 0.4

## Intended Use
This model should be used to predict the salary category of a person based off the US census data. Users could be researchers, social anthropologists, or hobbyists.

The web API accepts JSON for individual inference, and a csv file for bulk inference.

## Training Data
The data is the [Census Bureau data obtained from Udacity](https://github.com/udacity/nd0821-c3-starter-code/blob/master/starter/data/census.csv). The original data had 32,561 rows and a 80-20 split was used to break this into a train-test set. No stratification was done.

Categorical features were set as:
- `workclass`
- `education`
- `marital_status`
- `occupation`
- `relationship`
- `race`
- `sex`
- `native_country`

The remaining columns were set as continuous features. The target class was `salary`, which was assigned as a binary classification of `<=50k` and `>50k`. A one hot encoder was used on the features and a label binarizer on the `salary` target label.

## Evaluation Data
The evaluation data as mentioned above, was split with a proportion of 20% from the cleaned data. The overall model metrics computed is based off this test data.

The split was made with a random seed of `42` using data from `clean_census.csv`.

## Metrics
The model was evaluated using the precision. Its overall precision obtained by the model is ~80%, with a recall of 56% and fbeta score of 66% (see [scores.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mohrosidi/mlops_census/master/logs/scores.json)). 

## Ethical Considerations
Given the census data contains sensitive, and highly charged information like education levels, gender and race, the predicted output of this model should not be taken with a high degree of confidence without further testing for bias.

## Caveats and Recommendations
The distribution of the census data is skewed heavily towards certain categorical features. There is significant under-representation of some races, workclass, education levels, marital status and native country in the data (see [slice_output.txt](https://github.com/mohrosidi/mlops_census/blob/master/logs/slice_output.txt)).

As this model was not extensively tested and a hyperparameter search was not performed, it is recommended that further work to first increase the overall model performance be done, and then make subsequent attempts to gain a better dataset that is more representative of a distribution of the overall US population.
